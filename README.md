# ðŸ“Š Clustering with DBSCAN and KMeans

A machine learning project demonstrating how to perform unsupervised clustering using **DBSCAN** and **KMeans** on 2D synthetic data. This project helps visualize the differences between density-based and centroid-based clustering approaches.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

- **KMeans** (Centroid-based clustering)
- **DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
