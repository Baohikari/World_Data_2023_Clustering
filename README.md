# 🌍 World Data Clustering with KMeans and DBSCAN

This project applies **unsupervised clustering** algorithms — **KMeans** and **DBSCAN** — to explore and analyze global indicators using the `world_Data_2023` dataset. Evaluation is conducted using **Silhouette Score** and **Davies-Bouldin Score** to assess cluster quality.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **KMeans** (Centroid-based clustering)
- **DBSCAN** (Density-based clustering)
- Evaluation:
  - **Silhouette Score**
  - **Davies-Bouldin Score**
